The projection tool can be found in the top left corner in the UI.  Create a new layer so you can project new materials
on to the mesh.  Projections are usualy used as full materials differing from stencil which is used as a secondary
screen space mask.  In the projection properties all of the material presets are activated.  Click on the materials
button to choose a preset material for the projection.  Color, height, roughness, metal and ambient occlusion can be
painted at the same time.  Tap the c key to move through all of the maps you have created and you will see the painted
material on each map.  

Smart materials are pre-made materials that you can copy and share across other pieces of geometry.  You do not need to re-make complex stacks of effects.  
Right click on the layer group and choose create smart material.  Substance painter will auto generate thumbnails of
your smart material when you create the pre-set.  They will be in the materials menu on the bottom of your screen.
Click and drag the new thumbnail in to the layer editor of a new mesh.  Smart materials are "smart" because the 
generators for the material use the additional map information.  Overall smart materials give you a robust option to
share materials across texture sets and projects.
