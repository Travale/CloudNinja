Textures are created for materials.  In substance painter the materials are not connected.  There is a layer for
all of them.  The channels box above the additional maps can have new channels added to it.  The settings are specific
to the texture set.  The baking tool allows for textures specific to the material set as well.  Moving to maya: materials
must have specific Id's to be used in to substance painter. To activate all parts of the model while painting go to 
edit then settings and uncheck the box which says "only display the material being painted".  Upgrade the resolution
by choosing the size in the texture set settings.

Baking maps is one of the first things you do when importing a mesh to substance painter.  Within the baking options
you can tweak the frontal and rear distance.  The frontal distance distance represents the point of origin from which 
the ray is cast in to the seam.  Rear distance tells it when to stop.  The low resolution mesh can be represented as 
a white box.  The high resolution mesh box surrounds it.  The virutal envolope that projects rays in to the mesh could be
represented as a box surrounding these other two boxes.  Increase the distance of the ray will travel with the distance 
value.  It is a matter of seeing how far apart your meshes are.  In the baking options there is also an id map.  This
map allows masking.
